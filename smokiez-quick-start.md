# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - Deploy in 5 Minutes

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (RECOMMENDED - Easiest!)

### Step 1: Get Your Files Ready
1. Create a folder called `smokiez-dashboard`
2. Copy these files into it following this structure:

```
smokiez-dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ postcss.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.node.json
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.css
    â””â”€â”€ main.tsx
```

**All these files are in the Claude conversation above as separate artifacts!**

### Step 2: Deploy
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" (free - use GitHub/Google)
3. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
4. Drag your `smokiez-dashboard` folder into the upload area
5. Click "Deploy"

**That's it!** In 2 minutes you'll get a URL like:

Share this URL with anyone - they can access the dashboard instantly!

**"npm command not found"**
â†’ Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

**"Build fails on Vercel"**
â†’ Make sure all files are in the correct folder structure

**"Dashboard not loading data"**
â†’ Excel file must have the correct 6 sheets (see README)
